# ELC-paddle-frontend-assessment

This is my solution of a timed frontend assessment test organized by ELC.

The libraries used in this pro are

1. React Router Library for routing.
1. Axios Library for fetching API data.

## To navigate to the gituhb page, type in github after the "/" symbol in the url

If I had more time and this application was not a timed-test-project,
I would lve to improve on the user interaction in a way that mmakes users enjoy spending more time on the website.

To create a production build version, do "npm run build".
